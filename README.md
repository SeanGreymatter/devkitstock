# devkitstock

Stock control system for a small development kitchen

This is my first foray into the usage of SQL and will be using SQLite
to create a small database program that will keep track of stock in a small development
kitchen that will have the following features:

* Basic CRUD functionality (create, read, update, delete)
* Keep recipe data and upscale amounts based on desired batch size (input by user)
* Adjust stock amount based on recipe used
* Generate reports - remaining stock/ stock use trending
* OOD warnings on the day
* OOD warnings of approaching UBDs (adjustable by user)
*
